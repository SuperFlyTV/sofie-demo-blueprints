# Jingles

To use jingles, add the `Jingle Timings` Blueprint Configuration to the show style. These are in the form:

`JINGLE_NAME:FRAMES_OF_ALPHA`

For example:

`2019_Sport:40,2019_NBA:50`

Means the jingle `2019_Sport` has 40 frames of alpha at the end, and `2019_NBA` has 50 frames of alpha at the end.
